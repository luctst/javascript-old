            <p><em><small>An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between
            a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property
            is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define
            your own objects.</small></em></p>

          <ul class="list-group mt-4 mb-4">
            <li class="list-group-item">In javascript there are two ways creating objects, the
            <code>literal object</code> and with the <code>Object.create()</code> method, we will use
            the first method because she is the more using.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">To create an object simply use <code>{}</code> after your variable name.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Object work with a <code>key: value</code> method, to create
            a new <code>property</code> add the name of your <code>property</code> and use <code>:</code>
            to give us a <code>value</code>, don't forget to separate you <code>properties</code> with
            <code>,</code> .</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">To access <code>properties</code> in object you have two
            <code>methods</code> .</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">the first one is by using the <code>.</code> notation like our first
            example use <code>object.property</code> to access a value. The second one is by using a method
            who looks like array method which mean that you can use <code>[]</code> after your object and
            enter the name of your <code>property</code> like our second example.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">You can also <code>change</code> the value of your properties.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Like for access value there are many ways to change value of your properties,
            the first one is by directly change the value in <code>your object</code>, and the second one is by
            using one of the methods above (we recommand the first one) and use <code>=</code> to give
            a new value.</li>

          <ul class="list-group mt-4 mb-4">
            <li class="list-group-item">We saw that in an object <code>properties</code> are like
            variables you can store values by using <code>key: value</code> syntax but we can also use
            <code>functions</code> in an object and it's called <code>methods</code> .</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Function in object works exactly like <code>properties</code> but
            instead of giving a <code>value</code> you have to use the syntax of a <code>function</code>
            and that's it you can write your code inside your function.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Now that your function is create you maybe want to call
            her and it's really simple too, you just have to use this syntax, <code>object.functionName()</code>.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Note : You maybe saw this strange keyword <code>this</code> inside of our
            function don't worry we will explain his utilities later in the course.</li>
